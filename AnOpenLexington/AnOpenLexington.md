An Open Lexington

Despite our individual political viewpoints, we can likely agree on one practical point. Government data belongs to the people. Just as we assert that government representatives work for the people, so too the data that government agencies generate should be made freely available to the people. It makes sense that a popular representative government is held to account. The Freedom of Information Act (1966) and OPEN Government Act (2007) are some examples of legislative initiative to make information and data accessible to the public. However, the mechanism whereby a citizen must make a formal request appears inefficient and unnecessary for most data. In an era where information has never been more accessible and whose distribution has never before been so effortless, it seems reasonable that all public information should be publicly available online for bulk download, available in an open machine readable format, and legally repurposed. However, sometimes there is resistance to open data. Sometimes, there are difficulties in the release of information. Sometimes bureaucracy, politics, or special interests get in the way of transparency. Sometimes advocacy is required.

Here, we would like to introduce OpenLexington (ligature or not? consensus?). OpenLexington is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that is working to promote local transparency and empower citizen through open data. We are working with the Lexington Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) to make public data more open, available and useful. OpenLexington will make data requests, provide a mirror of data, provide a open machine-readable version of data (if not already available), and create application programming interfaces for researchers, analysts, journalist, and scholars to access LFUCG data programmatically. 

Transparency advocates often assert than an open and transparent government is key to a greater, inclusive, more effective, and more trustworthy democracy. Similarly, many researchers and citizen engineers have argued that information wants to be free, open, and accessible. Our technological progress continues to bring government and transparency closer to each other. Together in cooperation with LFUCG, active citizens, and OpenLexington, we can make our city even greater, inclusive, and more effective. Lexington can do this. Lexington can achieve an open and transparent local government, and we can make it happen. This isn't a new idea. There are plenty of other cities who have already embraced transparency and open government. We can learn a lot from their experiences. A few of those great cities are Austin, TX; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Ann Arbor, MI; San Francisco, CA; and Washington, D.C. Why not Lexington too. 

Lexington is a great place to live and work. It is also the perfect model of a mid-sized city to adopt open data and open government - An Open Lexington. 




<< notes; loosely connected ideas; audience?; message? >>

The idea of a government constructed by, built for, and accountable to the people is not a new one. It's the very foundation of our great nation. An accompanying idea to that of a popular representative government is one that information wants to be free. An open and transparent government is key to a greater, inclusive, more effective, and more trustworthy democracy. Data belongs to the people.

But sometimes, there is resistance. Sometimes, there are difficulties in the release of information. Sometimes bureaucracy, politics, or special interests get in the way of transparency. Perhaps, that's just the way of things. Rather, that's the way things were. 

Information is stored digitally. This information is stored in database servers hidden in the back office closet, stored in massive data centers, stored on tiny flash drives. The distribution of knowledge and information has never before been so effortless. 

If government information is public domain and the distribution of this information can so easily be accessed through web infrastructure then all it is reasonable that all of this information should be publicly available online.

Lexington is a great city to live, work, and raise a family. 

Lexington is a perfect model for local transparency of mid-sized cities.

Transparency benefits the people. Complete transparency and open government data benefits local businesses, university scholars,
